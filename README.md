## Project goals ##
The goal of this To-Do App is to practice working with JavaScript code for tasks that might use similar logic.
It was a first change to play around with local storage and rearranging the list items that are shown depending on the filter.

## App description ##
One out of thousands to-do lists, works like any other one. You can add items, check them as "done" or delete them. You also have a few tabs that will filter out which tasks will be shown: all, completed or incompleted. The app also saves the tasks into your local storage, so next time you reopen or reload the page, everything will still be there.
